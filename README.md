# Rocket-Elevators-Python-Controller
This is the template to use for the python residential controller. You will find the classes that should be used along with some methods described in the requirements. The necessary file to run some tests is also included. 

### Installation

First, depending on your python version, make sure to install the Package Installer for Python (PIP) if needed:

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

Next, install Pytest:

https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/getting-started.html

### Running the tests

To launch the tests:

`pytest`

With a fully completed project, you should get an output like:

You can also get more details about each test by adding the `-v` flag: 

`pytest -v` 

which should give something like:

The test file can be left in your final project but no scenarios should be present in your code. The grader will run tests similar to the ones provided.

Of course, make sure to edit this Readme file to describe your own project!
